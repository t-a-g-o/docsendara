# Introduction to Docsendara

Docsendara is a documentation engine that lets you serve, edit, and manage docs directly from your GitHub repository with minimal setup. It is designed for fast, beautiful, and collaborative documentation.

## What You Get
- **Live Markdown Rendering**: Docs are fetched and rendered from your GitHub repo.
- **Easy Editing**: Edit any page on GitHub with a single click.
- **Customizable Navigation**: Sidebar and topnav are driven by simple config files.
- **Author & Contributor Info**: Show who wrote or contributed to each page.

## How It Works
1. **Configure your repo**: Point Docsendara to your GitHub repo and docs folder.
2. **Write docs in Markdown**: Organize content in folders and files as you like.
3. **Edit config files**: Control sidebar, nav, and metadata in `src/app/utils/docsConfig.js` and `navConfig.js`.
4. **Browse and search**: Use the sidebar or topnav to explore your docs.
